  FOREWORD
  --------
   ___
    |
   _|_ originally created this engine out of a sense of preservation. GM8-based
  engines and games were rotting and obsolete when I arrived in this community,
  and the making of Guy Remastered was a painful process where we slowly
  refurbished a 9-year-old engine. I wasn't satisfied with the state of Studio
  engines either, and greatly due to Studio's problems, they felt far removed
  from that simplicity of opening GM and getting to work in a matter of seconds.

    And so, using Guy Remastered as a base, I decided to create a project that
  would satisfy my own standards for what an engine should aim to do for you.
  Not as much as to throw the maker out the window, but enough so that you don't
  need to spend so much time just fiddling with internals to get things to
  cooperate. Making a game should be a creative process, not a laborious one.
  
    I dedicate this engine to my good friend Natsu, who's been running his game
  ideas through me since we met in 2012, and my good friend Floogle, who drives
  me to complete great things. Great times were had and will continue to be.
